# Hey-World
Practicing making a repository
Still figuring out how to create repositories, new files, and etc. 

The nav-bar html will display javascript within the console as 
well as some css and html. 
It will display some DOM events as well as jQuery & AJAX.
This html will be my practice with writing javascript to 
prepare for assessments.
